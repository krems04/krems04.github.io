# Love in the time of Corona

Life kinda comes at you fast. Since the last post when i started looking to integrate the Echo Dot with a robot vacuum (which was easy) and Google Music (which was more difficult), a pesky pandemic has popped up.

So 1, since we're all quarantined, i figure it would be a good time to fork a game which would also help to give me some additional practice in stuff like node, Docker, containers, the like.

Also plan to look into Folding@Home to see if I can help out if possible.
